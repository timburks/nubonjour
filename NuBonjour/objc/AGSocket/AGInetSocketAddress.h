@class AGInetSocketAddress
@abstract AGInetSocketAddress is a subclass of AGSocketAddress for AF_INET (IPv4) addresses.
@discussion AGInetSocketAddress is a wrapper for a sockaddr_in structure. As a subclass of AGSocketAddress, it is suitable for use in AGSocket methods such as -readDataFromAddress:. 

Host addresses and port numbers are always in network (big-endian) byte-order.
