@class AGSocket
@abstract A wrapper class for BSD sockets and CFSocket.
@discussion AGSocket is a wrapper class for BSD sockets and is the main class in the AGSocket framework. It can be used for TCP sockets, UDP sockets, raw sockets, whatever.

An AGSocket is created with -initWithFamily:type:protocol:, which is analogous to socket(). Since most of the time you probably just want a TCP or UDP socket, the convenience methods +tcpSocket and +udpSocket are provided.

An AGSocket will deliver a delegate message when the following events occur: the socket became readable, the socket became writable, the socket completed or failed to complete a connection to a remote socket, or the socket accepted an incoming connection. Not all events apply to all types of sockets, obviously. You are not required to set the delegate, nor is the delegate required to implement any of the delegate methods, if you do not want to be notified of events.
