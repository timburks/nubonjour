@class AGSocketAddress
@abstract AGSocketAddress is a wrapper for a sockaddr structure. 
@discussion AGSocketAddress is a wrapper for a sockaddr structure. Usually you don't instatiate AGSocketAddress directly but one of its subclasses: AGInetSocketAddress, for AF_INET (IPv4) addresses, AGInet6SocketAddress, for AF_INET6 (IPv6) addresses, and AGUnixSocketAddress, for AF_UNIX addresses. 

AGSocketAddress is a class cluster. Concrete subclasses must implement the primitive methods -length, -setSocketAddress:length:, and -socketAddress. Additionally they should probably override any initializers declared here.
