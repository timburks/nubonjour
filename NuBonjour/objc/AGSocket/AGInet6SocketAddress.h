@class AGInet6SocketAddress
@abstract AGInet6SocketAddress is a subclass of AGSocketAddress for AF_INET6 (IPv6) addresses.
@discussion AGInet6SocketAddress is a wrapper for a sockaddr_in6 structure. As a subclass of AGSocketAddress, it is suitable for use in AGSocket methods such as -readDataFromAddress:. 

Host addresses must be a pointer to a 128-bit IPv6 address. Port numbers are always in network (big-endian) byte-order.
